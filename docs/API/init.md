# Keystone.init(options:object)

`Keystone.init` provides initial options to keystone. These are used to format and customise how keystone runs.

Some properties can be provided to init but not to [set](../set):

- cloudinary config
- auth
- nav
- mongo
- module root
- app
- mongoose
- frame guard

The initialization options can be found in the [configuration](/configuration) documentation.

For information on setting up keystone, see the [installation guide](/guides/setting-up/installation)

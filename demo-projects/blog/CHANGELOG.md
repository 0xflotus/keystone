# keystone_demo_blog

## 2.0.0

- [patch] 6fa810f7:

  - Rename `@voussoir/core` -> `@voussoir/keystone`. This is to free up the
    `@voussoir/core` package for a different purpose, and make the main import for
    new Keystone projects be `@voussoir/keystone`. The exports have stayed the
    same.

  - Remove unused dependencies

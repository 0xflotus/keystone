# KeystoneJS Starter Template

You've created a KeystoneJS project! This project contains a simple list of users and an admin application (`localhost:3000/admin`) with basic authentication.

There is no front-end application with this example but you can build your own using the GraphQL API (`http://localhost:3000/admin/graphiql`).

## Running the Project.

To run this project first run `npm install`. If you generated this project via the Keystone cli step this has been done for you.

Once running, the Keystone Admin UI is reachable from `localhost:3000/admin`. To see an example React app using Keystone's GraphQl APIs, head to `localhost:3000`.

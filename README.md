# keystone-5

This is a prototype architecture for Keystone 5.

Everything is WIP.

## Getting Started

Keystone 5 is set up as a monorepo, using [Bolt](http://boltpkg.com/)

First make sure you've got Bolt installed:

```
yarn global add bolt
```

Also make sure you have a local MongoDB server running ([instructions](https://docs.mongodb.com/getting-started/shell/installation/)).

Then install the dependencies and start the test project:

```
bolt
bolt start
```
